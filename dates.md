*BG* = This is a 'Best Group' competition
*AG* = This is the 'Andy Grimes Shield' competition

Bisley start time is at around 8:00am. Shooting commences 8.30am. 
Bisley Competition shoots will be squadded a week before the event.

All competition dates are at the end of the month except March to avoid BST change and April when Junction 3 of the M3 is closed on the 28th

There should hopefully not be any conflicts with the F-Class league dates

### Range fee for all shoots: £15 for members, £20 for guests
