___

The Piddlehinton shoots start at 12.30pm, the address is:
 
Old Army Camp,  
Piddlehinton,  
Near Dorchester,   
Dorset.  
DT2 7UA.
 
Enter the Trading estate and follow the road round to the right, up the hill, past the Tractor Dealers and the range is in front of you. ***Lock your cars at all times, even seconds. You will see why***.

___

Bisley start time is at around 8:00am. Shooting commences 8.30am. 
Competitions will be squadded “blind”.  You will still have to advise Steve of your intention to shoot approximately 7-10 days in advance as you do now. This is to allow the correct ordering of targets and markers. No squadding will be issued in advance. FTR and FO will shoot 1st/2nd on alternate months as now and FTR and FO will shoot paired and grouped together as now.
 
The arrangement will be that you will collect enveloped score cards from Steve as you pay your range fee,  The cards you receive will give your target position and a left or right firing point. Thus a card marked Detail 1 target 1 right hand point will be the first target on the the left and you will occupy the right hand side of the point.  The squadding will then repeat in the same positions after all firers have shot once.
 
The envelopes will be marked FTR or FO and I will have the correct number for the number of people who have booked to shoot.  The respective envelopes will have been well shuffled so consecutive envelopes might or might not contain adjacent firing positions.  Please do not swap cards about so that you shoot with your mate!

There should hopefully not be any conflicts with the F-Class league dates

### Range fee for all shoots: £15 for members, £20 for guests
